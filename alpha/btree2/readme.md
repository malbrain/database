This is an advanced btree implementation that doesn't use page locks.  The keys on each page are stored by their allocated page offsets and organized into a lazy skip list. Each page is identified by its logical page number (objectIDs), and indirect through the objectID slots to retrieve the page's physical address.  When a page fills two new pages are split from the original full page with their logical page numbers and fence keys installed in the next higher level closer to the root. The original full page is then retired.

Each variable length key on the page includes a random height skip tower with next key offsets.  Level zero of the towers form a sorted list of the keys.  New keys are spliced into this list with CAS, and are incorporated into the tower levels by subsequent descent operations.  Deleted keys are marked deleted and removed from the tower evels by subsequent descent operations.
