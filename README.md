malbrain/database
==========================

A working project for High-concurrency B-tree/ARTree Database source code in C.  This project was created as a sub-module for the /www.github.com/malbrain/javascript-database project, but it can also be used by itself as a database/indexing library. The API is documented on the Wiki pages.

The standalone.c test program exercises the basic functionality of the database, and can be used as a sample database application.  For a more complete example of how MVCC and transactions can be implemented on the database core functionality, please see the javascript-database project, partcularly the js_db*.c files.

Compile the database library and standalone test module with ./build or build.bat.

```
Usage: dbtest db_name -cmds=[crwsdf]... -idxType=[012] -bits=# -xtra=# -inMem -noIdx -noDocs -maxKey=# -minKey=# -keyLen=# src_file1 src_file2 ... ]
      where db_name is the prefix name of the database file
      cmds is a string of (c)ount/(r)ev scan/(w)rite/(s)can/(d)elete/(f)ind, with a one character command for each input src_file, or a no-input command.
      idxType is the type of index: 0 = ART, 1 = btree1, 2 = btree2
      keyLen is key size, zero for whole line
      bits is the btree page size in bits
      xtra is the btree leaf page extra bits
      inMem specifies no disk files
      noDocs specifies keys only
      src_file1 thru src_filen are files of keys/documents separated by newline.  Each is given to a new thread.
```
Linux compilation command:

    [karl@test7x64 xlink]# cc -std=c11 -O2 -g -o dbtest standalone.c base64.c db*.c artree/*.c btree1/*.c btree2/*.c -lpthread
