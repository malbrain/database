The primary data structure is the memory mapped arena which consists of DocID arrays which grow downwards from the end of the arena, and documents which are allocated space starting from the bottom of the arena. The DbAddr objects which identify these arena allocations are 64 bits.  The largest possible arena size is 64 GB, and 1000 arenas per collection.  Using the DbAddr means that multi-process and multi-threaded programs are suppoted with differing base addresses.

The database data structures support the DocID which is uniquely assigned to each document out of a segmented linear array created for each collection.  Each collection supports an arbitrary number of the Iterator and the cursor objects which return de-duplication sets of DocId and collection DbAddr.
